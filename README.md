# grid.js : A physics engine tailor-made for making 2D platformers

It is often difficult to handle the movement of your 2D platformer character using generic physics library. 
grid.js is built from the ground up with the intention of being used to make platformers. It also comes with
features that allow you to create modifiable grids like those of terraria or King arthur's gold.

# State of the library

The library is still in a very early stage of development:
- Though the core features are implemented and usable to make a simple platformer, some of the more elaborate features remain to be implemented
- Test coverage is minimal
- ..
These issues will be adressed as soon as possible and the missing features will be added. In the meantime, the library is perfectly fine to reproduce
the physics of games like super meat boy (without slopes), terraria (with ships if you so wish), super crate box, Super Mario Bros. (the first one ^^)..
